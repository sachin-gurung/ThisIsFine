Judging by the activation of the emergency lights it looks like the room has no power. On the opposite wall you can make out a series of breakers. As you approach the breaker you hear a disembodied voice that says 'If you want power, get all these breakers turned on. PULL a switch to activate others. Switches start at 0 and count up from there in a clockwise order.'",
