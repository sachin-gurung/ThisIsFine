   "description" : "You find yourself in the breaker room with only emergency lights illuminating the area. Next to you is a clear box with a key inside. You try to open the box but its locked. It looks like there is a latch powered by electricity. Judging by the activation of the emergency lights it looks like the room has no power. On the opposite wall you can make out a series of breakers. As you approach the breaker you see a note that reads “If you want power, get all these breakers turned on.”",
